## Credits

`pymenable` was created with
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and the
[`py-pkgs-cookiecutter` template](https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter).

The initial code for `pymenable` and the `examples`, came from the `ui` and `uiTest` (respectively) packages from the
[`aclu` (Accessible Command Line Utilities) project](https://github.com/ringcentral/aclu)
I started while at RingCentral.

The structure of the code including boilerplate for documentation and packaging came from the
[book on Python Packaging, _Python Packages_](https://py-pkgs.org/).
