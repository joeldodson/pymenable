# Changelog

<!--next-version-placeholder-->

## v0.1.0 (2022-09-02)

- First release of `pymenable`!
- This is very raw and in great need of docs and examples
- This release is the starting point to (hopefully) a complete package of Python classes to generate accessible HTML elements
- This code came from the [aclu (Accessible Command Line Utilities) project at RingCentral](https://github.com/ringcentral/aclu)
    - I pulled out the ui and uiTest packages to create a stand alone package to generate accessible HTML elements directly from Python code
- Next steps:
    - document the classes
    - create examples using Jupyter
